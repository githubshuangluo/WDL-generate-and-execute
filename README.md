# WDL-generate-and-execute
Writing a WDL
First, we'll introduce the building blocks of WDL and how they fit together to form the base structure of a WDL script. Then we'll show how to add variables so that input files and parameters can be specified outside of the script itself, which will allow you to use the same script for different runs without modification. Next, we'll cover how to add plumbing, i.e. how you can chain together the components that perform units of work in different ways to form sophisticated pipelines. Finally we'll look at how to validate syntax, which sounds boring but is really helpful since it will tell you quickly whether your WDL script is runnable or not. Because nobody likes starting a run only to see it fail because it's missing a semi-colon somewhere.
